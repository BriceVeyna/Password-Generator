# Password-Generator
This application can be used to generate random passwords based on specified input criteria.

## Description
This project takes the static base for a webpage to generate random passwords and adds the javascript needed to make it interactive. The site prompts the user with queries about the desired length of password and type of characters to include (lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters). It then generates a random password based on the user inputs and displays it.
